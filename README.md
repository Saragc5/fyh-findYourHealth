## Presentation
Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ my name is Sara GutiÃ©rrez Cortizo and this is my final project for CodeSpace Academy bootcamp, Full Stack Developer.

For the frontend part I have used ReactJS and SASS with CSS modules and for the backend part I have used NodeJS with Express.

For the database I have used MongoDB.

As security for the endpoints that need it, I have used bcrypt for password encryption and for the use of credentials through tokens, jsonwebtoken.


## The project has the following functionalities:
* Receive information from  users and blog database. 
* Create, modify and delete user profile with text and image data.
* Discriminate between one type of user and another to show different functionalities.
* Create new articles for the blog with text and image, not all users can do that.
* Contact form with administrators that reaches a database  for later response.
* Password modification and time to expire the session.
* It is fully responsive. The user profile also has the option of viewing it in phone size.

# Getting started
## 1. Requirements
Please check if you have everything installed, like apache2, npm and mongodb.

It will use ReactJs, React Router and NodeJS with Express and MongoDB for database.
## 2. Installing (getting my project from Github)
  git clone https://github.com/Saragc5/fyh-findYourHealth.git   
  open it in Visual Studio Code (or the code editor that you have)

## 3. Running the project:
### Import MongoDB file to your DB:
 * Open the Terminal and run: mongo (to connect to the server) 
 * With the Terminal, go to the directory where you have cloned the database that you want to import and run:
	* mongorestore --db fyh --archive=fyh.json
	* show databases
	* use fyh
	* show collections
There you will see 3 collections: blogarticles, contactforms and users.

#### Backend:
Open the project in: Codespace-final-project and install the dependencies in the directory Backend-component/server:
 * npm install
 * npm start

#### Frontend:
Open the project in: Codespace-final-project and install the dependencies in the directory Frontend_component:
 * npm install

##### You are ready to start!
